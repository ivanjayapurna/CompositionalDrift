Compositional Drift Version History

v1.0 (Release)
- fully functional GUI simulating copolymer growth with Mayo-Lewis Equation
and Monte Carlo method
- Graph representation of all simulated polymers
- Visualization of first (6-12) polymers
v1.1 (First Round Bugfixing)
- fixed major algorithm error with double rolling which gave preference
to larger weight chances
- fixed input error bug which caused program to crash
- added Not in Europe exception
TODO
- decrease runtime
- fix bug when back is pressed on fullscreen, should minimize
- add dyad pattern recognization and plotting
- fix negative number input bug
- fix two or more 0 input bug**IMPORTANT**
- add randomize visualization to show different polymer strands
-CODE CLEANUP: change Tk.IntVar variable naming to be like numSimsTkVar 
instead of numSims 


FINISHED TODO:
- fix bug where if numsims <  numrows, crashes
- fix hide/ unhide bug
- increase input box size to 4
- NOPE TOO ANNOYING: make it so graph and visualization canvas need not be destroyed every
time, causing glitchy graphics when simulatating more than once when
not on fullscreen
-fixed visualization bug
-fixed one 0 bug
-fixed not enough polymers bug
-implemented RAFT simulation
