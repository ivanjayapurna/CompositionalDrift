Compositional Drift Version History

v1.0 (Release)
- fully functional GUI simulating copolymer growth with Mayo-Lewis Equation
and Monte Carlo method
- Graph representation of all simulated polymers
- Visualization of first (6-12) polymers
v1.1 (First Round Bugfixing)
- fixed major algorithm error with double rolling which gave preference
to larger weight chances
- fixed input error bug which caused program to crash
- added Not in Europe exception
TODO
- decrease runtime
- fix bug when back is pressed on fullscreen, should minimize
- add dyad pattern recognization and plotting
- make simulation take from same pool of monomers (RAFT, free radical)
- fix negative number input bug
- fix all 0 input bug
-CODE CLEANUP: change Tk.IntVar variable naming to be like numSimsTkVar 
instead of numSims 
RAFT Simulation:
- all polymers are building at same time
- extra monomers will be left over, don't use them
Free Radical:
- polymers built one by one
- don't use leftover monomers

FINISHED TODO:
- fix bug where if numsims <  numrows, crashes
- fix hide/ unhide bug
- increase input box size to 4
- NOPE TOO ANNOYING: make it so graph and visualization canvas need not be destroyed every
time, causing glitchy graphics when simulatating more than once when
not on fullscreen
