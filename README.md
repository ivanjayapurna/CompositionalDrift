# Compositional Drift

This program tool allows polymer chemists easily to simulate the results of controlled polymerizations given all required reaction parameters (monomer amounts, monomer reactivity ratio, average polydispersity, ect.). The simulations use the Mayo-Lewis equation along Monte Carlo methods to predict polymer chain growth. The tool allows for rapid pre-experimental screening of reaction conditions along with critical post-synthesis analysis of the chain structure.

## Getting Started
The program can be accesed in several ways.

### Running via executable (Windows only)

1.Download and save the .exe file in the most current release

2.Run the program as an executable (certification is on its way)

3.Refer to the wiki for specific instructions

### Running via Web App

1.Go to https://vince-wu.github.io/CompositionalDrift/

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
